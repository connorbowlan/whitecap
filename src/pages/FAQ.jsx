          <h2>Does ONG support customers buying cheaper natural gas?</h2>
          <p>
            February 12, 2003 -- ONG President Sam Combs told the Oklahoma
            Corporation Commission "Our business is gas delivery, not gas
            sales." ONG is not allowed by tariff regulations to profit from
            natural gas sales. It makes economic sense for ONG to deflect some
            gas expenses to more efficient 3rd party gas supply. Large-volume
            natural gas customers have long profited from the ability to buy gas
            from non-utility suppliers and pay ONG a transportations-only rate
            to the point of consumption. Since 2003, ONG has encouraged
            qualified smaller-volume natural gas customers to take advantage of
            the available savings by buying from non-utility gas suppliers. ONG
            promotes 3rd party supply of natural gas to help customers save
            money.
          </p>

          <h2>What is the Choice Program?</h2>
          <p>
            The Choice Program allows qualified customers to purchase gas
            directly from a lower cost provider and elect to have ONG transport
            gas to them. WHITECAP, on your behalf, will manage the
            transportation service and sell gas directly to you. You will
            continue to get a bill from ONG for the transportation from the
            city-gate to the burner-tip.
          </p>

          <h2>How do I know if I qualify?</h2>
          <p>
            In 1984, ONG, with the approval of the Oklahoma Corporation
            Commission, began to allow NON-Residential customers to purchase gas
            directly from third party providers. At the request of ONG, over the
            years the minimum annual quantity required to participate has been
            reduced to 900 dekatherms (Dth) per year. If your annual gas
            consumption is greater than 900 Dth, you qualify.
          </p>

          <h2>What will ONG think about me switching sources of supply?</h2>
          <p>
            ONG is in the business of delivery of gas, not gas sales. ONG not
            only allows customers to participate, they encourage it.
          </p>

          <h2>If I switch from ONG, will I ever be able to go back?</h2>
          <p>
            It is possible to return to ONG after a year. However, once you
            begin saving on your utility bills, you won’t want to go back!
          </p>

          <h2>How do I establish the transportation service?</h2>
          <p>
            Transportation service with ONG is regulated by the Oklahoma
            Corporation Commission, and is initiated by completing ONG’s Agency
            Letter. WHITECAP will act as your agent.
          </p>

          <h2>
            If my company chooses to purchase gas from WHITECAP, what certainty
            do I have that gas deliveries will not be interrupted?
          </h2>
          <p>
            If for some unforeseen reason, WHITECAP was unable to deliver gas to
            ONG, you would still receive gas from ONG’s system gas. In the event
            of a pipeline catastrophe, ONG, as transporter, has a pre-determined
            priority for delivery to customers. However, at no time in the past
            has ONG failed to deliver gas to any customer.
          </p>

          <h2>How can WhiteCap's price be lower than what ONG charges?</h2>
          <p>
            The physical delivery of gas will not change, with the exception
            that a new piece of equipment may be installed by ONG for
            participation. This equipment is called an EFM or electronic flow
            measurement device which allows WHITECAP to see how much gas you are
            using on a daily basis. With this equipment we are able to make sure
            that we deliver as much as you need.
          </p>

          <h2>How will WHITECAP deliver gas to my facility?</h2>
          <p>
            February 12, 2003 -- ONG President Sam Combs told the Oklahoma
            Corporation Commission "Our business is gas delivery, not gas
            sales." ONG is not allowed by tariff regulations to profit from
            natural gas sales. It makes economic sense for ONG to deflect some
            gas expenses to more efficient 3rd party gas supply. Large-volume
            natural gas customers have long profited from the ability to buy gas

            money.
          </p>

          <h2>What will it cost to participate in the Choice Program?</h2>
          <p>
            ONG will charge the customer for transportation services and charge
            the customer for the cost of installing the new EFM device. WHITECAP
            will charge the customer for the gas supplied including WHITECAP’s
            marketing fee.
          </p>

            Will ONG confirm there will be savings through purchasing natural
            gas from a third party?
