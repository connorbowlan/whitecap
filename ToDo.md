Issues: 

-Hero Slider isn't showing images correctly, scrunched up and doubled. 

-Footer won't change, doesn't let me move it. 

-Page isn't fitting the screen, scroll bar shouldn't be there or need to be there. 


Ideas: 


-Include more pictures on the page besides just the hero slider in order to fill out the page and match the themes of the sections. 

-Re-implement the browser-links to new pages on-click for hte Home, About, Services, and Contact

-Include more content in Footer, it's shallow. 

-Add more variety to the layout besides the constant rectangles. 

-Provide links to buttons like Learn More.
